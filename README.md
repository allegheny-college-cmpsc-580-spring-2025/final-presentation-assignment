## Final Presentation

Your Final presentation is a `10` minute presentation composed of:

* an introduction to your project
* a short profile of you and your expertise as it relates to the project
* a summary of the problem or issue you hope to resolve
* a demonstration of the experiment you've conducted which proves viability
  * this includes both a demo _and_ a discussion of collected results, which
  * supports your conclusion that the project's worthiness of pursuit
    * keep in mind that it may turn out that your project _isn't_ worth pursuing; that's OK!
* future directions that your experiment and results indicate or imply
* a conclusion which reinforces the key points of your project

Attendees will be allowed `5`-`7` minutes for questions and comments.

### Turning in your presentation

To turn in your presentation, you will make one final `Presentation` post which contemplates the following:

* an appraisal of how you think the presentaton went with attention to how you succeeded and need to improve with:
  * your presentation mechanics (e.g. addressing the audience, use of gesture, vocal differentiation, et al.)
  * your presentation content (i.e. the design and density of your slides)
  * your presentation delivery (i.e. how well you believe you executed on the presentation's objectives)
* your ultimate judgment of the success of your viability experiment and how your results confirmed or supported your determination
* consideration of the questions and remarks you received during your presentation, addressing those that you see as _major_

### Structure

#### `Introduction`

Likely the most difficult part to get right, the `Introduction` features some formal constraint-based conventions
which make it a bit tough:

- [ ] the name of the project
- [ ] simple, succinct description of the project which is direct and _not abstract_
- [ ] the well-defined value/problem that the project, fully completed, will provide or solve
- [ ] evidence that provides scale or support for the value provided or problem addressed

While departures from this format obviously work, focusing on building your presentation from these elements
will help you to define your project in a clearer, more focused way.

#### `Expertise`

You've hopefully chosen your project because you're either deeply interested in or especially suited to it. While you're
not expected to be an expert, you possess compelling details that make _you_ the right person to take this project forward.
Some areas to cover in this section (not limited to):

- [ ] any areas where you've completed coursework (esp. a minor concentration)
  - you don't need to list individual courses
- [ ] involvement in a community around/for which this project is built
- [ ] curiosity in a subject and its application
- [ ] an intent to become a professional in a field encompassing or adjacent to your project
- [ ] a clear articulation of how this project achieves a non-academic goal

#### `Problem Summary`

While your introduction convinces an audience to pay attention it's your job to convert listeners from interested
and attentive to receptive and (hopefully) supportive of your intervention or solution. Here, the following elements might
help structure your approach:

- [ ] identify and share the biggest issue or broadest description of issues you're aiming to solve
- [ ] quantify or qualify these issues with more specific evidence that:
  - points toward the _how_ (the _method_) you're solving the issue
  - provides a sense of scale or impact that a solution could have on the area of interest
- [ ] factor(s) that differentiate this attempt at creating value/solution from other similar efforts
  - namely, discuss how your solution differs (in, at most, `2` key aspects)

The point of this section shouldn't be to best competitors or other researchers, merely to demonstrate that there's
efficacy in your approach that explores new (or old!) opportunities.

Here, if you've got graphs or charts: bring 'em. Statstics that underscore your point? It's probably _now_ or never.

#### `Demonstration`

Yes, we require you to present a live demo. There are many reasons for this: namely that videos of technology are, by and large,
not interesting to watch. So, instead, we will live on the bleeding edge for `2` minutes. 

Your demo should:

- [ ] demonstrate most major aspects of the exxperiment in at least one use case
- [ ] be an interactive demo in which the presenter uses the software, while they
- [ ] provide narration that explains the significance of the steps taken and outputs generated, and
- [ ] describes why your solution is _novel_ to the problem area being explored

> Note: if software fails or crashes during a live demo, _it's not the end of the world_ and is not automatically
> going to fail a presentation. Just ask Bill Gates, who experienced a [Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW7Rqwwth84)
> during a key demonstration of Windows 98.

#### `Experimental Results`

Having conducted your experiment(s) to understand the efficacy and effectiveness of your artifact(s), present those to
the audience to persuasively describe the relative success or general failure of the project. Here, there are three
main categories of success: `success`, `qualified success`, `failure`.

Here:

- [ ] describe, at a high level, the structure of your experiment(s) and what they sought to demonstrate or find out
- [ ] display at least one figure, chart, graph, or other visual containing key, compelling results
- [ ] highlight nuances of surprising data and the effect(s) it has or will have on your idea or approach
  * the outcome of this experiment could indicate that you need to try an entirely different method, while keeping your problem area the _same_

#### `Future Directions`

Use this section to describe the _potential_ of what you've uncovered in the course of your work on your experiment. You should
feature at least three (`3`) areas that you judge to possess signficant promise for thesis-level expansion. You aren't "locking in"
to these ideas, but they provide the ability for faculty to see how deeply you've explored the subject. This may include:

* application areas that are (or aren't) intuitive or obvious uses of your research
* extensions of or additional unexplored areas of the topic that you're interested in completing
* research that indicates the opposite or a contrary approach to yours that you'd like to benchmark _against_

#### `Conclusion`

It's easy at this point to believe that your presentation, as full of content as it is, says and shows enough. However,
consider your `Conclusion` your opportunity to further shape and refine the impact that your 4-minute data dump will have.
To achieve this successfully, list the `3` or `4` facts about your project that you want the audience to remember. No need
to stealthily introduce these: it can be an explicit list of features with some reminders or re-situation. These points
constitute what you'd most like folks to ask you about after your presentations; they serve as points of engagement.

You want to leave your audience with a sense of concreteness and cohesiveness, arriving at the end of a highly-structured
and practiced `10` minutes whose conclusion feels clear and inevitable. Second only to the [`Introduction`](#introduction)
in difficulty, the `Conclusion` is possibly the most important section in the presentation: it serves as the _last_ thing
anyone will see or hear.

### Slides

The following guidelines and suggestions will appear arbitary and restrictive, but focus on a couple of key assumptions
derived from situations where slide decks go wrong:

1. Slides are not for the presenter (i.e., you)
2. Slides merely support a presentation and are not, themselves, a substitute for one

Similar to the description of the [presentation `Conclusion`](#conclusion), we'll assume that folks have a limited memory.

Let's follow [the former Y Combinator Partner Kevin Hale](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/how-to-design-a-better-pitch-deck/)
on a general rubric for _all_ slides:

> * Make it legible
> * Make it simple
> * Make it obvious

#### Design

##### On legibility

Many slides aren't _readable_ because color choices do not provide enough contrast (i.e. ability to differentiate between any
two colors on a slide). In addition, slides often cram a lot of type on a single slide (even slides for this course are
guilty of this). Here are there rules to heavily consider:

1. use a sufficiently large typeface for everyone in the room to read
2. pair colors which feature high difference (i.e. contrast)
3. use fewer than 10 words on a given slide

##### On density

Slides which feature multiple, competing ideas are confusing. Each slide's content should represent one idea and _only_ one idea.

##### On content

Looking at the amount of information expected to come from the presentation, we encounter a problem: how do we present this information
with restrictions that make it seem like there should only be `7` (or fewer) slides? We do it in `7` or fewer slides.

Keep in mind that this presentation is not for the presenter relaying the content. Slides shape the _experience_ of the physical
presentation. The ways in which a given slide reinforces (but does not _duplicate_!) what the content you're delivering helps
the audience with our two retention problems:

* the audience will only pay attention to 1 idea at a time
* folks will really only remember the 3-4 facts you use as your presentation `Conclusion`

##### On practice

In one verb: _practice_.

Presentations are capped at `10` minutes. It'll be over before you know it and, if you don't have the chance to make it to
the ultimate concluding slide(s), you've lost your chance to make the presentation feel (as written above) _clear_ and _inevitable_.

Short assignments in this course will force you to practice, though you should practice even more on your own. You should
practice with friends that know your project. You should practice with friends that don't know your project. You should
practice with your readers. You should organize practice sessions with other folks practing and order pizza.

Ideally, practice with anyone who you can convince to pay attention.

As presentation day approaches, you should be able to present your `10` minutes as if a set of memorized facts. The only way you get there
is through practice.

### Evaluation

Presentation attendees have the opportunity to submit scorecards for each project. These scorecards are organized around the criteria
defined at the start of this document and are `Yes`/`No` responses to a series of questions with additional space to rate a given
presentation as `Exceptional` in a particular category.

The evaluation form will be released on presentation day. Attendees will be given a short amount of time between presentations
to complete the form.
